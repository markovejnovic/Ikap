# [DEPRECATED] Ikap

**This code is now abandoned. No support is available.**

Ikap (International Kitchen ~~AP~~ - the meaning of AP has been lost to time)
used to be a management website for managing time allocation for the
international kitchen in UWCCSC.

The international kitchen was the only place in which students could cook. Due
to many time conflicts that occured, a need for management software was found.
Ikap attempted to be a simple solution for users - they'd be able to sign up
without logging in and all other students were able to see if the kitchen was
still available.

This code is now **abandoned** and should never be touched again.

## Code Quality

This code was originally written as a result of very bad decisions on one poor
night. It's basically all glued together with hope and prayers.

If you want to learn Java, or make something, steer clear from this repository.

## Drawbacks

There is no API whatsoever, the UI lacks a lot, database interaction is slow,
since this is running on SQLite; the list goes on.

## Results

Hope and prayers or not, to my memory this software did the job it needed to
do, so I'd call it a success.

## Licensing

The code is licensed under [WTFPL](https://github.com/markovejnovic/ikap/LICENSE).
